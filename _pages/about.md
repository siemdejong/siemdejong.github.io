I'm a PhD candidate in the [Radboudumc Computational Pathology Group](https://computationalpathologygroup.eu) since September 2023.
As part of the [IMAGIO project](https://imagioproject.eu/), I'm developing AI algorithms to detect lung cancer in higher harmonic generation microscopy (HHGM) images of biopsies and resections for intraoperative decision-making.

I obtained my Master's degree (cum laude) in [Biophysics and Biophotonics at the University of Amsterdam and VU Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/physics-and-astronomy-biophysics-and-biophotonics/biophysics-and-biophotonics.html) where I applied deep learning to HHGM images of human skin tissue for stress-strain curve regression, and pediatric brain tissue for tumor classification.
